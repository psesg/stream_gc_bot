# While the above example is very simple, it's a good starting point for building more complex conversational apps. Notice how the bot responds instantly to your input. In the next section, we'll add a delay to simulate the bot "thinking" before responding.
#
# Build a simple chatbot GUI with streaming
# In this section, we'll build a simple chatbot GUI that responds to user input with a random message from a list of pre-determind responses. In the next section, we'll convert this simple toy example into a ChatGPT-like experience using OpenAI.
#
# Just like previously, we still require the same components to build our chatbot. Two chat message containers to display messages from the user and the bot, respectively. A chat input widget so the user can type in a message. And a way to store the chat history so we can display it in the chat message containers.
#
# Let's just copy the code from the previous section and add a few tweaks to it.

import streamlit as st
import random
import time

st.title("Simple chat")

# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])

# Accept user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
    # Display user message in chat message container
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)
    # Add user message to chat history
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})

# The only difference so far is we've changed the title of our app and added imports for random and time. We'll use random to randomly select a response from a list of responses and time to add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding.
# All that's left to do is add the chatbot's responses within the if block. We'll use a list of responses and randomly select one to display. We'll also add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding (or stream its response). Let's make a helper function for this and insert it at the top of our app.

# Streamed response emulator
def response_generator():
    response = random.choice(
        [
            "Hello there! How can I assist you today?",
            "Hi, human! Is there anything I can help you with?",
            "Do you need help?",
        ]
    )
    for word in response.split():
        yield word + " "
        time.sleep(0.05)
# Back to writing the response in our chat interface, we'll use st.write_stream to write out the streamed response with a typewriter effect.

# Display assistant response in chat message container
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    response = st.write_stream(response_generator())
# Add assistant response to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
# Above, we've added a placeholder to display the chatbot's response. We've also added a for loop to iterate through the response and display it one word at a time. We've added a delay of 0.05 seconds between each word to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding. Finally, we append the chatbot's response to the chat history. As you've probably guessed, this is a naive implementation of streaming. We'll see how to implement streaming with OpenAI in the next section.

# Play around with the above demo to get a feel for what we've built. It's a very simple chatbot GUI, but it has all the components of a more sophisticated chatbot. In the next section, we'll see how to build a ChatGPT-like app using OpenAI.
#
# Build a ChatGPT-like app
# Now that you've understood the basics of Streamlit's chat elements, let's make a few tweaks to it to build our own ChatGPT-like app. You'll need to install the OpenAI Python library and get an API key to follow along.
#
# Install dependencies
# First let's install the dependencies we'll need for this section:

# pip install openai streamlit
# Add OpenAI API key to Streamlit secrets
# Next, let's add our OpenAI API key to Streamlit secrets. We do this by creating .streamlit/secrets.toml file in our project directory and adding the following lines to it:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
# Write the app
# Now let's write the app. We'll use the same code as before, but we'll replace the list of responses with a call to the OpenAI API. We'll also add a few more tweaks to make the app more ChatGPT-like.

import streamlit as st
from chat_openai import OpenAI

st.title("ChatGPT-like clone")

# Set OpenAI API key from Streamlit secrets
client = OpenAI(api_key=st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

# Set a default model
if "openai_model" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["openai_model"] = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])

# Accept user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
    # Add user message to chat history
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    # Display user message in chat message container
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)
# All that's changed is that we've added a default model to st.session_state and set our OpenAI API key from Streamlit secrets. Here's where it gets interesting. We can replace our emulated stream with the model's responses from OpenAI:

    # Display assistant response in chat message container
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        stream = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=st.session_state["openai_model"],
            messages=[
                {"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]}
                for m in st.session_state.messages
            ],
            stream=True,
        )
        response = st.write_stream(stream)
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
# Above, we've replaced the list of responses with a call to OpenAI().chat.completions.create. We've set stream=True to stream the responses to the frontend. In the API call, we pass the model name we hardcoded in session state and pass the chat history as a list of messages. We also pass the role and content of each message in the chat history. Finally, OpenAI returns a stream of responses (split into chunks of tokens), which we iterate through and display each chunk.
